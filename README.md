**Overview**

The objective of this project was to select a Kaggle dataset and complement it with information from another website. This information should be obtained through the website's API or using web scraping.

The dataset selected from Kaggle is *Top 50 Spotify Songs - 2019*, and additional information has been obtained by scraping Spotify's website. In order to develop this project three playlist have been used: *El Top 50 de Espa√±a*, *El Top 50 de Estados Unidos* and *El Top 50 Global*. 

In the process of scraping Spotify's website a problem arose. Only information of the 30 first songs of each playlist could be obtained. 

**Sources and libraries**

Pandas, Regex, BeautifulSoup, Requests, Matplotlib and Seaborn 


**Development**

The first part of this project is centered in importing the Kaggle dataset and obtaining the information from Spotify's playlists using *pd.read_csv* for the first one, and *requests.get()* and *BeautifulSoup(response.content)* for the latters. 

Afterwards, I have followed a process to clean and set the different dataframes with the objective of creating a final dataframe (data_final) from which the final analysis has been done. 

The analysis has been mostly visual, but it has been included a column in wich we can see the percentage of each music style in their respective playlist. 


**Conclusions**

The results show that the most popular styles in general are: pop, hip hop, latin, reggaeton and trap. 

In 2020 there has been an increase in popularity of the hip hop and trap globally. Pop music keeps its position as most popular music style worldwide. 

In the USA, pop music and hip hop are clearly the most popular genres. 

In Spain there is a certain preference towards latin music, including reggaeton, and trap. 


**Further comments**

In order to use Spotify's API wihtout having to do all the process of authorization, python offers a library that makes this process much easier. This library is [spotipy](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.16.1/).

A way to enrich this analysis could be to use the information of other sites like Itunes or Soundcloud, with the objective of comparing how preferences in music differ in differente music browsers.
